    "0.13534475848.27": "Changes:\nBugfixes and performance improvements. Err, I mean...\n\n- Krez Kra color depth is now limited to 12-bit (was 24-bit) to make them more likely to stack\n- Krez Moqua color depth has been limited to 15-bit (was 24-bit) as well\n- Adjust beam brightness scale for Krekon\n- Fixed Krekon count not syncing to clients causing beam to be too dim until the GUI was opened\n- Fixed a crash related to sound play events\n- Tweaked Herobrine",
    "0.13534475848.17": "Major New Features:\n- Depleted Krez can now be broken by shift-rightclicking - this produces 4 Krez Kra and a Krekon\n- Krez Kra can be crafted into a similarly colored translucent block, which the quarry cannot mine\n- Krekon can be used to provide a speed boost to a quarry; up to 16 can be added with diminishing returns (16 is equivalent to Efficiency IV)\n- Krez repair may now occur between item frames\n\nMinor New Features:\n- Added another new Krez type\n- Added a creative tab\n- Krez now pulse while in item frames\n- Vanilla sand-containing recipes are now corrected to use the sand oredict, to make Mineral Sand useful\n- Mineral Sand can now be smelted into light gray stained glass\n\nChanges:\n- Quarry speech subtitles now only show when within 8 blocks of the source of the speech\n- Krez now last 50% less time to encourage Unbreaking and make it more reasonable to obtain the new items\n- Quarries now drop their held items when broken (this was previously a non-issue as quarries were unbreakable in survival while they held a Krez, but they may now hold Krekon as well)\n- Fixed quarries not starting correctly if they were asked to mine an area wholly in front of one they previously mined out\n- Fixed mining area not syncing correctly\n- Fixed quarries sometimes getting stuck for no reason",

    "0.13534475848.0": "Major New Features:\n- Krez may now be repaired by dropping two of them on the ground at different heights; the one higher up will transfer its durability to the lower one, with speed dependent on height difference\n- Krez no longer despawn when on the ground\n- Quarries now evaporate water into Mineral Sand to prevent flooding\n- Added Herobrine\n\nMinor New Features:\n- Added new Krez types\n- Added config option to adjust meteor rarity\n\nFixes:\n- Made meteors rarer when not holding an active Transceiver\n- Quarry speech now belongs to the \"Voice/Speech\" sound category\n- Fixed various effects not working in multiplayer\n- Fixed quarries deactivating before they finished \"downloading\" items\n- Fixed meteor spawns flying into unloaded chunks\n- Meteors may no longer fall in non-\"surface\" worlds\n- Krez may no longer be enchanted with Mending (it did nothing)\n- Mirror rendering has been tweaked slightly",
