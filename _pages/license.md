Yes, this license means you can use it in modpacks. Without asking. Really.
Please do not ask. The only conditions are you credit us (BY), don't make money
off it (NC), and don't make changes to it (ND).

We consider the mod authorship information shown in the mods screen, as above,
sufficient credit in modpacks. Other uses (websites, redistributions, etc) must
link back to the original page for the mod here on carbide-sun.github.io.

None of our mods will be distributed on CurseForge; this is the official
website at carbide-sun.github.io. The website's content, including text and
screenshots, is *not* Creative Commons like our mods; it **must not** be
reproduced, copied, or otherwise. Link, don't mirror.
