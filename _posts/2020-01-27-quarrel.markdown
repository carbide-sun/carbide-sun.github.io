# Description
Quarrel is an alien-themed magitech mod centered around an extremely overdone
laser quarry. It's the result of asking the question "what if quarries, except
laser", being bored, and following every tangential idea to its logical
conclusion and allowing those tangents to shape the mod.

To get started, first you'll need to find a meteorite containing the <span k krez></span>
you need to power the quarry. <span k krez></span> gems are randomly
generated and have a wide variety of parameters, including color and cadence. Some
kinds of <span k krez></span> are rarer than others; maybe you can
find the ultimate one? (Note: All these parameters are purely cosmetic, but their
overall rarity is factored into a couple things.)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/quarrel-krez.png)

You can make these easier to get by creating a Yagi-Uda Helmet and Transceiver
to politely confuse the alien satellites dropping these strange objects onto the
planet. The Transceiver can be tuned to any frequency between 1100MHz and 1300MHz
in increments of 25MHz; based on the world seed, each frequency has its own
strengths and weaknesses.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/quarrel-uda.png)

The quarry talks in an intentionally-designed alien conlang and all words in
this conlang are written in a custom font.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/quarrel-speaking-2.png) <audio src="{{site.baseurl}}/audio/quarrel-nogem.mp3" controls></audio>

<span k krez></span> are enchantable with any pickaxe enchantments,
which will be used by the quarry. Rarer <span k krez></span>
are better for enchanting, with the ultimate <span class="kezequk">Zepazker Krez</span>
being as good as gold.

They also take damage in the form of Whacks for all damage they do to a block.
This differs from durability since it applies even if the block isn't broken;
relatedly, laser quarries know how to work together and if two are mining the
same block, will break it faster.

The quarry additionally has a GUI that can be used to swap out <span k krez></span>,
see its current progress, and set the area it will mine in. Each square
is 5x5 blocks, with the maximum possible area being 45x45.

# Known Issues

* The mirror's angle makes no sense. It's sometimes close enough but other times
  way off; trigonometry is hard, okay?
* Lasers are too thin from some angles. (More slightly-busted trig we were tired
  of messing with.)

The <span k kezequk></span> font was created by heavily modifying an English
8x8 bitmap font until it was mostly unrecognizable, in a process inspired by
the creation of the Standard Galactic Alphabet, then vectorizing it. Similarities
to other scripts, natural or constructed, is purely coincidental and unintentional.
