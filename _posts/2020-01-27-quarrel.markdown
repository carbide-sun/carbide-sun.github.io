# Description
Quarrel is an alien-themed magitech mod centered around an extremely overdone
laser quarry. It's the result of asking the question "what if quarries, except
laser", being bored, and following every tangential idea to its logical
conclusion and allowing those tangents to shape the mod.

To get started, first you'll need to find a Meteorite containing the <span class="kezequk">Krez</span>
you need to power the quarry. <span class="kezequk">Krez</span> gems are randomly
generated and have a wide variety of parameters, including color and cadence. Some
kinds of <span class="kezequk">Krez</span> are rarer than others; maybe you can
find the ultimate one? (Note: All these parameters are purely cosmetic, but their
overall rarity is factored into a couple things.)

You can make these easier to get by creating a Yagi-Uda Helmet and Transceiver
to politely confuse the alien satellites dropping these strange objects onto the
planet. The Transceiver can be tuned to any frequency between 1100MHz and 1300MHz
in increments of 25MHz; based on the world seed, each frequency has its own
strengths and weaknesses.

The quarry talks in an intentionally-designed alien conlang and all words in
this conlang are written in a custom font.

<span class="kezequk">Krez</span> are enchantable with any pickaxe enchantments
which will be used by the quarry. Rarer <span class="kezequk">Krez</span>
are better for enchanting, with the ultimate <span class="kezequk">Zepazker Krez</span>
being as good as gold.

They also take damage in the form of Whacks for all damage they do to a block.
This differs from durability since it applies even if the block isn't broken;
relatedly, laser quarries know how to work together and if two are mining the
same block, will break it faster.

# Contact

**If you are rude I will ignore you, period**. I don't use an issue tracker or
forum, comments, etc. Instead you can contact me via email — [carbide-sun@pm.me](mailto:carbide-sun@pm.me).
Warning: don't waste my time. I do this as a small hobby for fun.

Feel free to ask questions, report bugs, talk about mods in general, etc. As
long as you're polite and understand I have better things to do than field
vitriol.
